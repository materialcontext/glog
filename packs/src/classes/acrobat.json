		"The Greatest Escape": "Once per lifetime, you can literally escape death.  Your DM will describe the afterlife to you, as well as the opportunity that allows you to escape (if  you wish to). This ability has no effect if your body has been destroyed beyond plausibility. A solo adventure to return to the land of the living is encouraged, but not required."
